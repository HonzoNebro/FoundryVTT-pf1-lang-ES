Reloading the mortar is a full-round action, and the user loads a grenade-like projectile into the breech of the weapon's steel barrel, along with a blank rifle round that propels the bomb when triggered. The weapon uses indirect fire to lob bombs in slow-moving, high arcs, and the user targets a specific square.</p>\n<p>Rules for indirect-fire siege weapons are found on page 160 of Ultimate Combat or @Compendium[pf-content.pf-rules.Rft1LIY5C8XOK3Kr]{2.11.4.4. Siege Engine Details}. Mortars can also be fired as direct-fire siege engines. When used for direct fire, they take a -4 penalty on attack rolls and their range increment is halved, but they do not have a minimum range. After the point of impact is determined, the shell explodes and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage to all creatures in a 30-foot radius (Reflex DC 20 for half ).</p>\n<p>An Aasen mortar has hardness 10 and 35 hit points; it fires special, finned fragmentation bombs that cost 10 gp each and weigh 4 pounds each. These bombs usually arrive on the battlefront in wooden cases containing 6 mortars each.</p>"

The nonmagical flame deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all targets within the cone of the scatter firearm (DC 15 Reflex save for half). These cartridges cannot be used in firearms that don't have the scatter weapon quality. Because this ammunition forces a saving throw instead of making an attack roll, the misfire rules are slightly different. If you roll a 1 with either of the damage dice, the firearm misfires.</p>"

It otherwise follows all rules for using an off-hand weapon. Attacking with a barbazu beard provokes an attack of opportunity.

This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, or until the creature is treated with a successful DC 15 Heal check or receives at least 1 point of magical healing.

A corvus is usually 10 feet wide and 15 feet long. It has a hardness of 5 and 10 hit points per square.</p>\n<p>Using a corvus requires a DC 10 Profession (siege engineer) check as a full-round action; if the check fails, the corvus fails to catch on the target and must be reset (a full-round action). A corvus mounted on a vehicle can target another moving vehicle (see Chapter 4: Vehicles). Doing so requires an opposed driving check to get the corvus into the correct position, which is within the length of the corvus and adjacent to the other vehicle. Once a corvus is attached, it takes a Strength check as a full-round action to dislodge the corvus. Alternatively, if the corvus is attached to a vehicle, either vehicle driver can make a driving check as a standard action to dislodge the corvus (a check that succeeds by 5 or more destroys the corvus).</p>\n<p>The base DC for either of these checks is 15, and the DC increases by 5 for every Small or Medium creature currently standing on the corvus. If a corvus is disengaged while creatures are standing on it, those creatures must make a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or fall. Succeeding at the saving throw allows them to move to the nearest area of safe ground, but such movement provokes attacks of opportunity. A corvus cannot be armored.</p>"

A dwarven heavy pelletbow takes the same amount of time and effort to load as a light crossbow (normally a move action), and a dwarven light pelletbow can be reloaded as a free action (allowing characters to attack with it multiple times in a round). Normally a pelletbow takes two hands to operate, but you can shoot (but not load) a pelletbow with one hand by taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls. You can shoot one pelletbow with each hand, but you take a penalty on attack rolls for attacking with two weapons (treating the heavy pelletbow as a one-handed weapon and the light pelletbow as a light weapon). </p><p></p><p>Feats and special abilities that don't involve proficiency (that don't depend on dealing piercing damage or firing bolts) that apply to a heavy crossbow also apply to a dwarven heavy pelletbow, and those that apply to a light crossbow also apply to a dwarven light pelletbow.</p>"

The wire is placed across a victim's throat and crossed behind the neck; when the handles are pulled tight, the garrote strangles him. In order for you to use a garrote, your opponent must be helpless or unaware of you. You must make a grapple check (though you avoid the -4 penalty for not having two hands free) to successfully begin garroting your opponent. Sneak attack damage does not apply to a garrote. Your garroted opponent must make a concentration check (DC 20 + your CMB + level of the spell he's casting) to cast a spell with a verbal component, use a command word item, or use any magic requiring speech. You gain the following additional option when grappling with a garrote.</p><p></p><p><em>Choke</em>: You cut off your target's air supply so he has to hold his breath (see Suffocation on page 445 of the <em>Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook</em>, and the Swim skill on page 108). Any round you do not maintain the choke, your opponent can take a breath and restart when he has to begin making Constitution checks.</p>"

It is usually placed on the  ground and triggered so that the wind blows the gas toward  enemy positions. Normally, multiple gas cylinders are  placed in line and triggered together to cover a wider area  of the battlefield. First, determine what direction the wind  is blowing by rolling 1d4 (1 is north, 2 is east, 3 is south,  and 4 is west). When triggered, a gas cylinder releases a  cloud of mustard gas (see the sidebar on page 67) in a 15-  foot cone. On the following 2 rounds, the cloud extends  by an additional 15-foot square away from the canister,  forming a 15-foot-wide, 45-foot-long cloud at the end of  3 rounds. The cloud moves with the wind, rolling along  the surface of the ground, and disperses after 10 rounds. A  strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the cloud in 4 rounds, and  a severe wind (31+ mph) disperses it in 1 round.</p>"

Wielding a gastraphetes requires two hands, and due to the weapon's bulk, firing it while standing without support (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imposes a -4 penalty on attack rolls; you take no penalty for firing a gastraphetes while prone. A Large or larger creature can use a gastraphetes one size smaller than itself without any support, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately sized weapon.</p>"

The British military produced the Lawrence  1917, which found its way into the hands of  Russia's soldiers. The device consists  of a cumbersome backpack  of two tanks and a swivelmounted,  handheld projection  unit, or \"lance.\" When the device  is aimed and a small hand lever  depressed, a small gas burner ignites the oil, which is  propelled forth in a blazing stream of intense flame. A  f lamethrower with full tanks is capable of unleashing up  to 6 charges of ignited oil, to devastating effect.</p><p></p><p>  When using a flamethrower, the wielder projects a  60-foot-long line of fire, attempting a separate attack roll  against each creature within the line. Each attack roll takes  a -2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified  by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as  Vital Strike. Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or  smoke, or the <em>blur</em>, <em>invisibility</em>, or <em>mirror image</em> spells, do not  foil this line attack. If any of the rolls threatens a critical  hit, the wielder confirms the critical for that roll alone.</p><p></p><p>  All affected creatures take 4d6 points of damage,  and any creature hit by the flaming stream must also  succeed at succeed at a DC 20 Ref lex save or catch fire,  taking an additional 2d6 points of damage each round  until the flames are extinguished. A burning creature  can attempt a new save as a full-round action, and  dropping and rolling on the ground grants a +2 bonus  on this save.</p><p></p><p>  The device's tanks and backpacks are awkward, and the  wielder takes a -4 armor check penalty when wearing the  cumbersome device. In addition, the tanks have hardness  10 and 5 hit points, and if the tank is ruptured in the  presence of any adjacent flame (including the device's own  gas igniter), a mighty conflagration erupts, the wielder  takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and all creatures within a  20-foot radius take 3d6 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 20  for half ). Any creatures who take damage must succeed at a  DC 20 Reflex save or catch on fire.</p>"

These large, two-handed tridents are much heavier than normal (12 pounds) in order to take advantage of their wielders' great strength, and as a result they lose their range increment but deal 1d10 points of damage and have a x3 critical hit multiplier. In addition, extensive ritualistic practice with this weapon gives the lizard king the Improved Critical (war trident) feat as a bonus feat. A war trident is worth 20 gp, although most are masterwork and many are inlaid with precious metals and fetch higher prices.</p>"

If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows.

Each rope gauntlet takes a full minute to wrap and another minute to soak, but once applied the gauntlet can be worn for a day; removing a rope gauntlet takes 1 full round. When wearing rope gauntlets, you are considered armed and your attacks deal normal damage. If you are proficient with rope gauntlets, you may use the rough edges of the ropes to deal slashing damage rather than bludgeoning damage. Your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in your hands while wearing rope gauntlets, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles gives you a -2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving your hands (such opening locks).</p>"

The weapon threatens only foes within this cone and within its extended reach. You can't change the area you threaten with the sarissa until your next turn.

Bombards are normally fired indirectly, but can also be fired as direct-fire siege engines.

Many take the cauldron shape of the light bombard, but they may also take the forms of more traditional cannons, albeit featuring stabilizing mechanisms that allow them to fire at a much steeper incline. The targeting DC of a standard bombard is 20. A standard bombard has a misfire range of 1-2 (20 feet). Standard bombards have a hardness of 10 and 140 hit points. Standard bombard balls cost 35 gp each and weigh 30 pounds.</p><p></p><p> <em>Heavy</em>: These massive siege engines are often fixed to positions on high hilltops or atop massive keeps, raining death down on a valley or strait. Often these firearms come in two pieces connected by a screw mechanism. The bombard is unscrewed to be loaded, and then the main part of the muzzle is screwed back on to the barrel section in order to be fired. Heavy bombards are too large and powerful to mount on vehicles. The targeting DC of a heavy bombard is 25. A heavy bombard has a misfire range of 1-2 (30 feet). Heavy bombards have a hardness of 10 and 280 hit points. Heavy bombard balls cost 45 gp each and weigh 50 pounds.</p>"

Metal components consist of an alloy of aluminum and steel that exceeds the strength of Earth metals (giving Barsoomian firarms a hardness of 12). Radium weapons ?re special cartridges that must be manufactured under artificial light, as exposure to sunlight results in an explosion. When the cartridges strike their target they shatter exposing the radium powder within. The moment sunlight strikes this substance it explodes with considerable violence, making the weapons versatile for either direct fire or suppressive fire. Radium weapons follow the general rules for advanced firearms found in <em>Path?nder Roleplaying Game: Ultimate Combat</em>.</p><p></p><p> All radium weapons use radium cartridges for ammunition. As a result. in addition to targeting specific creatures or objects. the wielder may fire a radium weapon at an unoccupied square similar to throwing a splash weapon (<em>Pathfinder RFC Core Rulebook 202</em>). All creatures within 15 feet of the targeted square take 2d6 points of bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage (Reflex DC 15 half). Radium cartridge damage does not change based on the size of the weapon used to fire them. Radium cartridges cannot be fired effectively in this way outside the rays of the sun, such as underground or at night. Radium cartridges cost 3 gp per cartridge.</p>"
